... tries to be a NewPipe clone for Linux on desktop and mobile.

** Design decisions

- The UI should match that of NewPipe, with GTK widgets. I am not a designer
and I dont know how to make custom widgets, or make nice UI, so I just copy
what works!

** Road map:

[x] Cache for thumbnails.

[] Video page, with description, download and other buttons.

[] Popular videos page.

[] Make downloads work with yt-dlp or so... or maybe make it myself?

... many more missing features!

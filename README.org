* DewDuct

... tries to be a NewPipe clone for Linux on desktop and mobile.

** Design decisions

- The UI should match that of NewPipe, with GTK widgets. I am not a designer
and I dont know how to make custom widgets, or make nice UI, so I just copy
what works!

** Installing

*** Dependencies

Run time dependencies:

openssl gtk4.0 libadwaita mpv

Compile time dependencies:

rust cargo openssl-dev gtk4.0-dev libadwaita-dev

*** Building and installing

**** PostmarketOS and Alpine linux:

```
apk add rust cargo openssl-dev gtk4.0-dev libadwaita-dev openssl gtk4.0 libadwaita mpv

cargo install --git https://github.com/DaKnig/DewDuct
```

** Road map:

For version 1.0 :

[x] Popular videos page.

[x] Cache for thumbnails.

[x] Video page, with description, where you could press to play video.

[] Select quality of video.

[x] Popular videos page.

[] Make downloads work with yt-dlp or so... or maybe make it myself?

[x] Search for videos and channels.

[] Subscribe to channels.

[] Subscription list page.

[] Subscription video list, with a button for updating the list.

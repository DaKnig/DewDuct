... tries to be a NewPipe clone for Linux on desktop and mobile.

** Design decisions

- The UI should match that of NewPipe, with GTK widgets. I am not a designer
and I dont know how to make custom widgets, or make nice UI, so I just copy
what works!

** Road map:

For version 1.0 : 

[x] Popular videos page.

[x] Cache for thumbnails.

[-] Video page, with description, download and other buttons. (everything but download functionality works)

[x] Popular videos page.

[] Make downloads work with yt-dlp or so... or maybe make it myself?

[x] Search for videos and channels.

[] Subscribe to channels.

[] Subscription list page.

[] Subscription video list, with a button for updating the list.
